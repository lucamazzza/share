# Share

Share is a small sowftare, allowing simple chats through the `LAN`, without authentication or anything else.
It is just a quickly-developed proof of concept, wich is not of great utility, but allows you to chat with someone else in the network.

## Installation

Just clone the repository with the command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucamazzza/share.git
```

and run the application with

```bash
cargo run
```

> [!Note]
> You will need to install [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) to run the program.
